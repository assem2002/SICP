This procedure seems to be overwhelming as it has alot of branching going.
but if you think about it, it does a really simple thing it divides the list into half ,if it happens that you can't divide it evenly with an element in the middle
you just say that the left branch is the small one like (1 2 3) this could be divided evenly (2-> middle , 1->left , 3 ->right),while something like (1 2 3 4) would go like that
(2 ->middle , 1 -> left ,(3 4) ->right )
