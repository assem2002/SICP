it will build a cycle.
the last-pair function has it's base case to terminate the recursion -> finiding a nil which can't be found in this data object.
inifinte recursive call -> call stack overflow.
A Small Note:

data objects when binded they bind by pointers so when you pass them,you can mutate and the change will affect all bindings
(define a (list 1 2))
(define b a)
(set-car! b 1000)
a -> (1000 2)
b -> (1000 2)

While...

(define a 3)
(define b a)
(set! b 1000)
a -> 3
b -> 1000
