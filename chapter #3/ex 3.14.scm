the code does a list reverse.

by taking a pair by pair from the first to the end of the original list and add them disattacheing the first pair from the list sequence and make it point to the last reversed pair.

v as variable points to  the first pair (cons a (POINTER)). when the code runs, the cdr goes and point to '().

so now v will equal ->(a)
w ->(d c b a)
