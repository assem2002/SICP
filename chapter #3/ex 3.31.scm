After so much diging into the internet, I found that not executing the procedures that the wire has whenever it gets added to it would make so many problems.
thing like an inverter box which has two wire input and output, if the functionality of the wire is not applied right away, the inverter would have a state of (0 --inverter--> 0) because the wire preserve
their inital local state which is "zero".
