a)
 
- There's 6 possible orders (3*2*1).
-> peter paul mary --> 45
-> peter mary paul --> 35
-> paul peter mary --> 45
-> paul mary peter --> 50
-> mary peter paul --> 40
-> mary paul peter --> 40

b)
If the three operations happen concurrently and somehow all of them posses the value $100, this would result in a finial value of ethier 110,80,50 which are all wrong (relative to the amount of money in and out of the bank account)
