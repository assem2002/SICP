the first procedure has the set x out of the seralizer, which gives the possiblity of the second procedure to access either (10 or 11 or (11 and 10)) -remember that second procedure access x twice-.
so we would be left with the following x =  (10*10),(11*11),(11*10) and the set x in first procedure could wait till second procedure sets x to whatever and then set! x make the varaible x end up with 11 or 10.

so all 5 possibilties exist still.
