;It won't converge. 
; (* n (factorial (-n 1 ))) -> would get called over and over even if the predicate is true
; and the base case is met to halt on the recursive call, it still get called as it is passed to "unless" as an argument
; that need to be evaluated

; This shows as that primitve "if" in scheme is 'non-strict procedure'.

;If our language follows the normal-order --> yeah, it would converge .
