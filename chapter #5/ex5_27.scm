; The total number of pushes in recursive process seems to be less than iterative call
; This maybe due to hanlding more variables (2 more) than recurive function
; but I think if my machine can have dedicated registers for these 2 It would be the same number of total pushes
; but with larger number of variables to be used in our code, It would surely show the same phoenmona
; our machines aren't made with infinite number of registers.
